      <p>Hi I’m Oscar Morales an indie developer living in Guatemala! I do roles such as Programmer, Designer, Artist and Composer. My main bread and butter is programming.

        Currently working on Ultra Zultra. Using Unity3d with C# and visual studio. For this project i’m making all the pixel art, music and code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new programming languages and have experience in:

        *C#
        *C++
        *Java
        *Javascript 
        *Haxe

        Learning is one of my main hobbies, makes making games hard sometimes since I always want to practice new things I learn.  But it’s worth it at the end, be it be something as simple as applying clean code, adding a super complex library, or adding new coding paradigms to different systems of my games.

        Tools wise I been using for more than 3 years in:

        *Unity3d
        *Visual Studio
        *Photoshop
        *GraphicsGale

        A little over 3 years ago I switch from haxe game tool pipeline to unity3d. It’s a very rewarding experience.  I still apply stuff i learn from using haxe today. 

        That’s me, if you need a tough as nails programmer contact me!
